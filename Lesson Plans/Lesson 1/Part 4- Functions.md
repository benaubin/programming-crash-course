## Part 4: Functions

Crash course has a great video on functions and statements and deals with it visually in an amazing way. We'll watch the video because it does a really good job explaining everything.

There are a few points where we should pause:

- At the first pseudo code shown, explain what it is and why they're using it
- Talk about abstraction
- Talk about the fact that Java requires declaration of a variable's type when variable assignment is first introduced.
- When for loops are shown, talk about how Java handles for loops and show why Java's version is just a more explicit version of the same thing.
- Explain levels of abstraction
- Talk about the 100 lines of code "modularization thing"
