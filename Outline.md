# Programming Crash Course: Outline

1. Basics
	- Hello World
	- Syntax, Basic terms
		- building blocks, write them out as lines of code that are variable declarations
		- talk about each `type`
	- Sequential execution
		- Talk about those lines of code. Write out lines of code to do a thing, probably like list out vending machine 
	- IF Statements
	- For/while loops
	- Input, Libraries

2. Functional programming
	- Hashmaps, in lua tables
	- Functions, how to avoid writing the same code and over
		- Scope
		- So if you can't use variables outside, arguments
		- Return values
		- Calling functions from functions
		- Recursion, Fibonacci will be a good demo

3. Fundamentals of object oriented programming
	- Classes
	- What's `this`
	- Instantiation
	- Inheritance
	- Reference vs value types
	- Interfaces

4. How to go forward
	- How to GitHub
	- How to Google
	- How to read api documentation
	- How and why to find libraries
